# Interviewing

## When to Use

- Requirements or goals are ambiguous
- User isn't clear about what they want
- Hidden complexity might derail implementation
- Another skill encounters fundamental ambiguity

Skip when requirements are already clear or user wants to proceed without clarification.

## Core Methodology

### Ask Non-Obvious Questions

Probe deeper than surface-level:

- **Why**: What problem does this solve? Why now?
- **Constraints**: What would make this unacceptable? What can't change?
- **Failure modes**: What's the worst case? What happens when X fails?
- **Success**: How will you know this worked? What does "done" look like?
- **Tradeoffs**: What are you willing to give up? Minimum viable version?
- **Assumptions**: You mentioned X, but what about Y? Is that always true?

### Avoid

- Restatements of what's already said
- Yes/no confirmations
- Generic questions that apply to anything
- Leading questions

### Follow the Thread

Dig deeper when answers reveal complexity. Don't jump topics when current one has unexplored depth.

### Batch Questions

Use `AskUserQuestion` with `questions` array for 2-4 related questions exploring different angles of the same area.

## Saturation

Stop when:

- Answers stop revealing new information
- You could explain requirements to someone else
- User expresses readiness to proceed

## Output

Summarize what you've learned:

```
**Clarified Requirements:**
- **Goal**: [specific goal]
- **Constraints**: [hard limits]
- **Success criteria**: [how we'll know it worked]
- **Key tradeoffs**: [prioritizing vs deprioritizing]
- **Open questions**: [if any]
```
