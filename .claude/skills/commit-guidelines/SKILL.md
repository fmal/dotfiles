# Commit Guidelines

## Principles

- Each commit should represent a complete, working change
- Commit messages must use conventional commits format

## Conventional Commits

Format: `<type>: <description>`

Types:
- `feat:` - new feature
- `fix:` - bug fix
- `chore:` - maintenance, dependencies, config
- `docs:` - documentation only
- `refactor:` - code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test:` - adding or updating tests
- `style:` - formatting, whitespace (no code change)
